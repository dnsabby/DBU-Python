# Objective: Apply data science concepts on a dataset of your choice.

# Tasks:
    # Acquire, clean, and preprocess data.
    # Perform EDA and visualize key insights.
	# Build and evaluate a machine learning model.

# Requirements:
    # Work on this as a group (Same team as the previous GIT exercise).
    # Use a dataset that is not used in the class.
    # Use at least 3 different visualization techniques.
    # Use at least 1 different machine learning algorithms.
    # Use at least 2 different evaluation metrics.
    # Use at least 2 different preprocessing techniques.

# Submission Timeline:
    # Submit the code and a report in 3 weeks.
    # The report should include:
        # Introduction to the dataset.
        # Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
        # EDA and key insights.
        # Machine learning model building and evaluation.
        # Conclusion.
        # References (if any).
